This is the repository for a Stardew Valley mod. It's in development and isn't available on Nexus Mods at the moment. The first chapter of the mod is available on Nexus Mods: [Creative Differences - NPC Rodney](https://www.nexusmods.com/stardewvalley/mods/13437).

At the moment, it adds two social NPCs to the game:
- Rodney O'Brien.
- Edwina O'Brien.

Planned social NPCs:
- Meredith O'Brien
- Tarroz

It also adds a number of custom items.

Feel free to plunder my code (just don't use any art or music without asking for permission first please).

## Requirements

This mod requires:
- [East Scarp](https://www.nexusmods.com/stardewvalley/mods/5787) (and all its dependencies). This is where the NPCs live.
- [SpaceCore](https://www.nexusmods.com/stardewvalley/mods/1348). This mod uses a few of SpaceCore's features for custom items and additional event commands.
- [MEEP](https://www.nexusmods.com/stardewvalley/mods/14493) This mod uses MEEP to display images in game (tarot cards mostly).

## Compatibility
- Compatible with Stardew Valley Expanded (NPCs from SVE have gift tastes & reactions for a few items added by this mod).

-    Compatible with Mobile Phone Continued.
-    Compatible with Romanceable Rasmodia - Female Wizard. If this mod is installed, Rodney & Ewina will now mention a witch instead of a wizard in their dialogue and events.
-    Compatible with Stardew Reimagined 3. Rodney has a dedicated schedule for the maps edited by this mod, but due to how the reimagined maps are layered, he may clip through benches from time to time. His schedule has been adjusted accordingly. Let me know if you find any issue.
-    As a part of East Scarp, Rodney will have something to say about what is going on in Never Ending Adventure, Yri The Architect, Always Raining in the Valley, Professor Jasper Thomas, Juliet & Jessie the Joja Clerks, Lavril, Lucikiel, Lurking in the dark, Fievel(including a crossover event), A New Dream and Nora The Herpetologist.
    He will also have dialogue if you have Juna, Realistic Writer Elliott, and More Conversation Topics.
-    Rodney will attend the following custom festivals: Fireworks Festival, Surfing Festival, Love Festival& Ferngill Fashion Festival. He will also attend the Marketpalooza Festival from the  Passerby Cemetery mod and he will have a shop there.

## FAQ

> Where does Rodney live?
He lives in the silo in East Scarp. It is located on the north east of East Scarp's Main area.

Can you make Rodney marriageable?
> No. Rodney is datable, but for story reasons that he will explain if you date him, you can't marry him.

Can I date Rodney and other NPCs as the same time?
> Yes! You can toggle RodneyPolyamory to true in the mod's config.
> Please note that even with this option toggled on, you will not be able to date Rodney & Elliott at the same time (because they are related). I will not change that, so don't ask.

Can you lower the amount of autographs?
> If you are referring to the number of autographs visible in water, this is due to [Visible Fish](https://www.nexusmods.com/stardewvalley/mods/8897). You can disable "Visible Trash" in the config of Visible Fish.
> If you are referring to the number of autographs you've been fished, you can disable AutotographSpawning in this mod's config.

What can I do with Rodney's autograph?
> You can recycle it in the recycling machine to get some useful material (cloth) or even a rare and much more valuable version of the autograph. It is also a liked and loved item for several modded NPCs. Or do what I do, give it to Lewis just to annoy him.

Can I get a version of this mod which doesn't require east Scarp?
> No.

Can I make on myself then?
> Nope.

Rodney is too mean.
> This is not a question.
